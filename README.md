# Commuttr — Cape Town journey planner

Commuttr tells a commuter which bus or train to catch, from where, and at what time.

Golden Arrow publishes its timetables as roughly 1,900 PDF files on
<https://www.gabs.co.za/Timetable.aspx> — readable by a person, useless to software. This
project downloads every one of them, reads the departure grids out of them, stores the
result in a database, and serves it through an API that a React app turns into a trip
planner.

Metrorail's are worse: five PDFs of **scanned images**, with no text layer to read and no
GTFS feed anywhere. Those go through an OCR pipeline of their own — see
[Refreshing the train timetables](#refreshing-the-train-timetables) — into the same tables,
so a train is planned by the same engine that plans a bus.

## What's in the box

Four separate pieces. You can run them independently.

| Piece | What it is | Lives in |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **The database** | PostgreSQL, running inside Docker. Holds every route, timetable and departure time. | `docker-compose.yml` |
| **The scraper** | Python. Fetches PDFs from the Golden Arrow site and loads them into the database. Run occasionally, not continuously — it is not part of serving the app. | `src/gabs_scraper/` |
| **The API** | Java / Spring Boot. Serves the data over HTTP and hosts the web app. | `backend/` |
| **The web app** | React. What a commuter actually sees — search, map, departure times. | `web/` |

### Which ports things use

| Port | What's there |
| --- | --- |
| **5433** | PostgreSQL (the database itself) |
| **5050** | pgAdmin — click around the database in a browser |
| **8000** | The API, and the web app it serves |
| **5173** | The React app in development mode |

Port 5433 rather than the usual 5432, so this doesn't clash with any PostgreSQL you
already have installed.

---

## Before you start

| You need | Why | Check it works |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Docker Desktop**, running | Provides the database. Nothing works without it. | `docker version` |
| **Java 21+** and **Maven** | Only if running the Java API | `java -version` and `mvn -v` |
| **Python 3.11+** | Only if running the scraper, the Python API, or the tests | `python --version` |
| **Node 18+** | To build the web app (`web/dist` is not committed, so you build it once) | `node --version` |

You do **not** need to install PostgreSQL. Docker provides it.

---

## Getting it running

Seven steps, in order. Steps 1–6 get you a working app; step 7 is only for frontend work.

### Step 1 — Start the database

This starts two containers: PostgreSQL, and pgAdmin for browsing it.

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

`-d` means "in the background". Check both started:

```bash
docker compose ps
```

You should see `gabs_pg` and `gabs_pgadmin`, both `Up`.

### Step 2 — Put the timetable data in

The repository ships a snapshot of the fully-loaded database, so you don't have to
download and parse 1,900 PDFs yourself. **This takes seconds.**

The snapshot carries timetables, stop coordinates and the fare tables for **Golden Arrow's
buses and Metrorail's trains**. It does **not** include MyCiTi - that is Step 3, and it
only takes a few minutes. You do not need to run the scraper, the geocoder, the fare jobs
or the OCR to get a working app with prices on it.

```bash
docker cp data/gabs_dump.sql.gz gabs_pg:/tmp/dump.sql.gz
docker exec gabs_pg sh -c "gunzip -f /tmp/dump.sql.gz && psql -U gabs -d gabs -f /tmp/dump.sql"
```

Confirm it worked:

```bash
docker exec gabs_pg psql -U gabs -d gabs -c "SELECT count(*) FROM timetable"
```

Around **1,878** is right. Check the fares came too, since an app without them shows
journeys with no prices:

```bash
docker exec gabs_pg psql -U gabs -d gabs -c "SELECT count(*) FROM journey_fare"
```

Around **20,400** is right. And that both operators are there, since the Metro Rail
filter is dead without the train timetables:

```bash
docker exec gabs_pg psql -U gabs -d gabs -c "SELECT o.code, count(r.id) FROM operator o LEFT JOIN route r ON r.operator_id = o.id GROUP BY o.code"
```

**793** for `gabs` and **10** for `metrorail` is right. There is no `myciti` row yet -
that comes next.

> No snapshot in your copy? See [Refreshing the bus timetables](#refreshing-the-bus-timetables) to
> build the database from the live site instead. That takes about 90 minutes.

### Step 3 — Add MyCiTi

MyCiTi is loaded from the 47 timetable PDFs in `data/myciti/`, which ship with the
repository, so this step needs no internet. Run these **in this order**, from the project
root, with the database running. Each one is safe to run again.

Use the block for the terminal you are in. **Windows PowerShell** (the default terminal on
Windows, and in VS Code on Windows):

```powershell
# 1. The tables a third operator needs (the snapshot predates them).
#    NOTICE lines saying something "already exists, skipping" are fine.
docker cp sql/operators.sql gabs_pg:/tmp/operators.sql
docker exec gabs_pg psql -U gabs -d gabs -f /tmp/operators.sql

# Lets python find the project's code. Needed once per terminal window.
$env:PYTHONPATH = "src"

# 2. The timetables: 47 routes, 521 stops, 151,593 times (~2 minutes)
python -m myciti_scraper.pipeline --no-fetch

# 3. Split the one stop name MyCiTi uses for two places ("Highlands")
python -m myciti_scraper.split_names

# 4. Put the stops on the map, from OpenStreetMap (uses the cached copy in data/myciti)
python -m myciti_scraper.positions

# 5. Make every MyCiTi stop searchable, and record which places MyCiTi serves
python -m gabs_scraper.areas --from-stops
```

**Git Bash, macOS or Linux:**

```bash
docker cp sql/operators.sql gabs_pg:/tmp/operators.sql
docker exec gabs_pg psql -U gabs -d gabs -f /tmp/operators.sql
PYTHONPATH=src python -m myciti_scraper.pipeline --no-fetch
PYTHONPATH=src python -m myciti_scraper.split_names
PYTHONPATH=src python -m myciti_scraper.positions
PYTHONPATH=src python -m gabs_scraper.areas --from-stops
```

> **Seeing `The '<' operator is reserved for future use`?** That is PowerShell refusing bash
> syntax. Every `PYTHONPATH=src python ...` command elsewhere in this README has the same
> problem in PowerShell: run `$env:PYTHONPATH = "src"` once, then type the command without
> the `PYTHONPATH=src` part.

**Do not skip steps 3 to 5.** Without step 4 no MyCiTi stop has a position, so no journey
can start or end at one. Without step 5 the MyCiTi chip offers no places at all, because
the search only suggests places an operator is recorded as serving.

If the API is already running (Step 4), **stop and restart it** - it caches place searches, so
MyCiTi places will not appear until it starts fresh.

Confirm it worked:

```bash
docker exec gabs_pg psql -U gabs -d gabs -c "SELECT o.code, count(r.id) FROM operator o LEFT JOIN route r ON r.operator_id = o.id GROUP BY o.code"
```

**47** for `myciti` is right, alongside 793 `gabs` and 10 `metrorail`. And that the stops
have positions:

```bash
docker exec gabs_pg psql -U gabs -d gabs -c "SELECT count(*) FILTER (WHERE s.lat IS NOT NULL) AS placed, count(*) AS stops FROM stop s JOIN operator o ON o.id = s.operator_id WHERE o.code = 'myciti'"
```

About **479 placed of 522** is right. The rest are stops OpenStreetMap does not have and
that could not be placed between their neighbours; the planner simply does not use them.

### Step 4 — Start the API

```bash
mvn -f backend/pom.xml spring-boot:run
```

It listens on port 8000 and also serves the web app.

Check it's alive:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/api/health
```

### Step 5 — Build the web app, once

The built app is **not** stored in the repository, so build it before the first run.
After that you only repeat this when the frontend changes.

```bash
cd web
npm install     # first time only
npm run build
```

That writes `web/dist`, which the API serves. **Restart the API afterwards** — it only
looks for the built app at startup, so a running one will not pick it up.

### Step 6 — Open the app

**Open <http://localhost:8000>.** That's the whole app.

If you see `{"detail":"Not Found"}` instead, the API started before `web/dist` existed.
Restart it and reload.

### Step 7 — Only if you're changing the React code

Skip this unless you're editing the frontend. It gives you hot reload, so you don't have
to rebuild after every change.

```bash
cd web && npm run dev
```

Now use **<http://localhost:5173>** instead. It forwards API calls to port 8000, so
**leave the API from Step 4 running**.

---

## Command reference

Every command, what it does, and when you'd reach for it.

### `docker compose up -d`

**Starts the database.** Run this first, every time. Safe to run when it's already up.

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

### `docker compose ps`

**Shows whether the database is running.** First thing to check when something won't
connect.

```bash
docker compose ps
```

### `docker compose stop`

**Pauses the database, keeping all data.** Use at the end of the day.

```bash
docker compose stop
```

### `docker compose down`

**Stops and removes the containers — but keeps the data.** The data lives in a Docker
volume that survives this. Use `docker compose up -d` to bring everything back.

```bash
docker compose down
```

> **Careful:** `docker compose down -v` adds `-v` for *volumes* and **erases the database
> permanently.** Only use it when you deliberately want to start over.

### `mvn -f backend/pom.xml spring-boot:run`

**Starts the Java API on port 8000.** This is the main backend. Leave it running; stop it
with `Ctrl+C`.

```bash
mvn -f backend/pom.xml spring-boot:run
```

### `PYTHONPATH=src python -m uvicorn gabs_scraper.api:app --port 8001`

**Starts the legacy FastAPI service.** Not needed to run the app — only to compare it
against the Java one with `parity_check.py`, which is why it is shown on port 8001.

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src python -m uvicorn gabs_scraper.api:app --port 8001
```

### `npm run dev`

**Starts the React app with hot reload on port 5173.** Only for frontend work. Needs an
API running on port 8000.

```bash
cd web && npm run dev
```

### `npm run build`

**Builds the React app** into `web/dist`, which the API serves at port 8000. Required
once before the first run, since `web/dist` is not committed, and again after any
frontend change. Restart the API afterwards — it looks for the built app only at startup.

```bash
cd web && npm run build
```

### `python -m gabs_scraper.pipeline --all`

**Downloads the latest timetables from Golden Arrow and loads them.** Takes roughly
90 minutes. See [Refreshing the bus timetables](#refreshing-the-bus-timetables) before running it —
it also *deletes* withdrawn timetables.

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src python -m gabs_scraper.pipeline --all
```

### `python -m gabs_scraper.geocode`

**Puts new stops on the map.** After a refresh, new stops have names but no coordinates.
This looks each one up. Uses Google if `GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` is set, otherwise
OpenStreetMap for free.

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src python -m gabs_scraper.geocode
```

### `python -m gabs_scraper.geometry`

**Works out the roads each bus actually drives.** Needed for custom-stop planning ("I'm
not at a bus stop, which bus passes me?"). **Requires `GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY`** — there is no
free alternative for this one.

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src python -m gabs_scraper.geometry
```

### `python -m gabs_scraper.fares`

**Scrapes the published fares.** Reads the operator's multi-journey fare page into the
`fare` and `fare_zone_stop` tables. Takes about a minute.

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src python -m gabs_scraper.fares
```

### `python -m gabs_scraper.pricing`

**Works out the price of every journey**, into `journey_fare`, so both the Java and the
Python service read one set of numbers instead of each resolving fares themselves. Needs
`fares` to have run first. Takes about a minute.

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src python -m gabs_scraper.pricing
```

### `python -m prasa_scraper.pipeline`

**Reads the Metrorail timetables** out of the scanned PDFs in `data/prasa/pdfs` and loads
what passes its checks. Takes about 20 minutes for all five files.

Each table on a page is read and checked on its own, and a table that fails is reported
and **held back rather than loaded** — the whole point of the checks is that times nobody
has looked at do not quietly become departure times a rider trusts.

```bash
# Everything
PYTHONPATH=src python -m prasa_scraper.pipeline

# One file, or one page of it, writing nothing
PYTHONPATH=src python -m prasa_scraper.pipeline --pdf southern-line-weekday.pdf --dry-run
PYTHONPATH=src python -m prasa_scraper.pipeline --page 2 --dry-run

# Load a held table anyway, once its problems have been reviewed
PYTHONPATH=src python -m prasa_scraper.pipeline --pdf northern-line-weekday.pdf --force

# Clear the operator's routes first, when the shape of the reading has changed
PYTHONPATH=src python -m prasa_scraper.pipeline --fresh --allow-unverified 3
```

Use `--fresh` after changing how the pages are read, not routinely. A load replaces a table
keyed by its page, which is right when a page is read the same way twice and only better —
and wrong when the shape changes. The Northern Line page used to be read as four tables and
is now read as one, so three of the four had nothing to replace them and simply stayed,
still offering a route out of Kraaifontein that gave up at Stikland.

### `python -m prasa_scraper.coverage`

**Checks the loaded stations against the printed ones.** Every other check in the scraper
is internal — is this cell shaped like a time, does this column run forwards — and a table
that failed its checks answers all of them by saying nothing, so a page whose grid was
never found looks exactly like a page with nothing on it. That is how Kraaifontein went
missing until somebody searched for it by name.

This reads the PDFs and asks the question directly. It reports three things:

| | |
|---|---|
| `MISSING` | printed on a sheet, not in the database — a station nobody can plan with |
| `UNPRINTED` | in the database, on no sheet — a name read badly enough to become its own station |
| `NO SERVICE` | loaded and searchable with not one departure |

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src python -m prasa_scraper.coverage
```

### `python -m prasa_scraper.positions`

**Finds stations that are on the map in the wrong place.** A station with no coordinates
draws no pin and plans perfectly well — journeys go by stop id. A station with the *wrong*
coordinates draws a line across the peninsula and puts itself into "nearest stops" for
places it is nowhere near, and every one of those answers looks as confident as a right
one.

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src python -m prasa_scraper.positions        # report
PYTHONPATH=src python -m prasa_scraper.positions --fix  # clear the ones that are wrong
```

`--fix` acts only on stations far from a Golden Arrow stop of the same name, which is an
authoritative comparison. The second check — a station far from its own line — only ever
reports, because it cannot tell which side of a disagreement is wrong. The first time it
ran it flagged the one correctly-placed station on a line where everything else had moved.

### `python -m prasa_scraper.duplicates`

**Reports stations that look like one place stored twice**, and stations that share a name
with a bus stop. It never merges anything: deciding that two spellings are one place is a
claim about Cape Town and belongs in the alias table where it can be read.

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src python -m prasa_scraper.duplicates
```

### `python -m pytest -q`

**Runs the Python tests.**

```bash
python -m pytest -q
```

### `mvn -f backend/pom.xml test`

**Runs the Java tests.**

```bash
mvn -f backend/pom.xml test
```

### `python backend/parity_check.py`

**Checks the Java and Python APIs still return identical answers.** Both must be running,
on different ports. Used before switching production from one to the other.

```bash
python backend/parity_check.py --legacy http://localhost:8001 --java http://localhost:8000
```

---

## Looking inside the database

### Where the data actually lives

The database runs inside a Docker **container** called `gabs_pg`. The container is
disposable — the data is not. PostgreSQL writes into a Docker **volume** named
`scrapercomm_gabs_pgdata`, which lives on your machine independently of the container.

That means:

- Restarting or rebuilding the container **keeps** your data.
- `docker compose down` **keeps** your data.
- Only `docker compose down -v` deletes it.

See the volumes:

```bash
docker volume ls --filter name=scrapercomm
```

### Option A — pgAdmin, by clicking

Easiest if you'd rather not type SQL.

1. Make sure the database is running (`docker compose up -d`)
2. Open **<http://localhost:5050>**
3. The server **GABS (local)** is already set up — click it
4. Password: `gabs`
5. Expand **Databases → gabs → Schemas → public → Tables**
6. Right-click any table → **View/Edit Data → All Rows**

### Option B — psql, by typing

Opens a SQL prompt inside the container:

```bash
docker exec -it gabs_pg psql -U gabs -d gabs
```

Useful once you're there:

| Type this | It shows |
| --- | --- |
| `\dt` | every table |
| `\d timetable` | the columns of the `timetable` table |
| `SELECT count(*) FROM route;` | how many routes exist |
| `\q` | quit |

Or run a single query without going in:

```bash
docker exec gabs_pg psql -U gabs -d gabs -c "SELECT count(*) FROM route"
```

### A quick health check

```bash
docker exec gabs_pg psql -U gabs -d gabs -c "
SELECT (SELECT count(*) FROM route)     AS routes,
       (SELECT count(*) FROM timetable) AS timetables,
       (SELECT count(*) FROM stop)      AS stops"
```

Roughly 793 routes, 1,878 timetables and 527 stops as of August 2026. These grow as
Golden Arrow adds services.

### Connecting any other tool

```
Host: localhost      Port: 5433
Database: gabs       User: gabs       Password: gabs
```

## Reading the search analytics

Every journey search is recorded, so you can see what commuters are actually looking for.
Recording happens in the background and never slows a search down.

### What gets recorded

Two tables:

| Table | One row per | Tells you |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `search_analytics` | search | where they searched from and to, how many results came back, how long it took |
| `search_analytics_option` | route offered | **which** routes came back, and how many departures each had |

The second table is what makes "which routes are people searching for?" answerable. The
first only counts results; it doesn't say which.

> Nothing is recorded about *who* searched — no names, no accounts, no session tracking.
> These are counts of searches, not of people.

### Which routes are commuters searching for?

The headline question.

```sql
SELECT o.route_label,
       o.timetable_number,
       o.day_type,
       count(DISTINCT o.search_id) AS searches,
       sum(o.departure_count)      AS departures_offered
FROM search_analytics_option o
GROUP BY 1, 2, 3
ORDER BY searches DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

### Which journeys are most popular?

Origin and destination, with real stop names instead of ID numbers.

```sql
SELECT COALESCE(so.name, 'dropped pin') AS origin,
       COALESCE(sd.name, 'dropped pin') AS destination,
       count(*) AS searches,
       round(avg(sa.option_count), 1) AS avg_results
FROM search_analytics sa
LEFT JOIN stop so ON so.id = sa.from_stop_id
LEFT JOIN stop sd ON sd.id = sa.to_stop_id
GROUP BY 1, 2
ORDER BY searches DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

### Where are we letting people down?

**The most valuable query here.** Every row is someone who searched for a journey and got
nothing back — a route Golden Arrow doesn't run, or one we don't have data for.

```sql
SELECT COALESCE(so.name, 'dropped pin') AS origin,
       COALESCE(sd.name, 'dropped pin') AS destination,
       count(*) AS failed_searches
FROM search_analytics sa
LEFT JOIN stop so ON so.id = sa.from_stop_id
LEFT JOIN stop sd ON sd.id = sa.to_stop_id
WHERE sa.option_count = 0
GROUP BY 1, 2
ORDER BY failed_searches DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

### When do people search?

```sql
SELECT date_trunc('hour', searched_at) AS hour, count(*) AS searches
FROM search_analytics
GROUP BY 1 ORDER BY 1 DESC LIMIT 24;
```

### Bus stops versus dropped pins

Shows how many people search from a real stop versus a point on the map, and what each
costs in response time.

```sql
SELECT endpoint,
       from_kind AS searched_from,
       count(*) AS searches,
       round(avg(option_count), 1) AS avg_results,
       round(avg(duration_ms))     AS avg_milliseconds
FROM search_analytics
GROUP BY 1, 2 ORDER BY 1, 2;
```

### Turning analytics off

Start the Java API with `ANALYTICS_ENABLED=false`. Searches keep working; nothing is
recorded.

---

## Refreshing the bus timetables

Golden Arrow republishes timetables constantly — 16 changed during a single afternoon in
August 2026, and many files expire within days. **Data goes stale fast.** This should
eventually run on a schedule rather than by hand.

### The full cycle

Three commands, in this order:

```bash
# 1. Download and load the latest timetables (~90 minutes)
PYTHONPATH=src python -m gabs_scraper.pipeline --all

# 2. Put any new stops on the map (~5 minutes)
PYTHONPATH=src python -m gabs_scraper.geocode

#    ...or just one operator's, when only theirs were placed by a weaker provider
PYTHONPATH=src python -m gabs_scraper.geocode --force --operator metrorail

# 3. Work out the roads for any new routes (needs a Google key)
PYTHONPATH=src python -m gabs_scraper.geometry

# 4. Scrape the published fares (~1 minute)
PYTHONPATH=src python -m gabs_scraper.fares

# 5. Work out the price of every journey (~1 minute)
PYTHONPATH=src python -m gabs_scraper.pricing
```

**MyCiTi** is refreshed separately. Without `--no-fetch` the pipeline checks myciti.org.za
for the current list and downloads any timetable not already in `data/myciti/` (delete a
PDF there to force it to be fetched again):

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src python -m myciti_scraper.pipeline
PYTHONPATH=src python -m myciti_scraper.split_names
PYTHONPATH=src python -m myciti_scraper.positions
PYTHONPATH=src python -m gabs_scraper.areas --from-stops
```

Steps 2 to 5 are **not** part of step 1. Skip 2 and new routes work for stop-to-stop
journeys but not for custom-stop planning. Skip 4 and 5 and every journey shows without a
price, which is the single most obvious thing a rider will notice.

### Rebuilding the snapshot

The snapshot in `data/` is what a fresh clone loads, so after a refresh it is worth
rebuilding - otherwise the next person to clone gets whatever the database looked like
last time somebody remembered.

```bash
docker exec gabs_pg pg_dump -U gabs -d gabs --no-owner --no-privileges   --exclude-table=search_analytics --exclude-table=search_analytics_option   | gzip -9 > data/gabs_dump.sql.gz
```

The two excluded tables are the search log. It is this installation's own usage data and
has no business in a public repository.

### Why a refresh also deletes things

This surprises people, so it's worth understanding.

The pipeline used to only ever *add*. That sounds safe, but it isn't: when Golden Arrow
replaces a timetable, the old one stayed in our database forever and the app kept showing
withdrawn departure times. In one check, only **366 of 1,868** stored timetables were
still published — the other 1,502 were showing times no bus was running.

A stale timetable looks exactly as trustworthy as a current one. That's worse than having
no data.

So a **full** refresh now deletes any timetable Golden Arrow no longer publishes, along
with the downloaded PDF. Two safety nets:

- If the download from the site returns nothing, it **refuses to delete anything** — that's
  a failed download, not Golden Arrow withdrawing every route.
- If you're testing with `--limit`, **nothing is deleted**, because you only fetched a
  sample.

Add `--no-prune` to keep the old data anyway. Not recommended.

### Other pipeline options

```bash
# Just check the download works, on 20 PDFs. Never deletes anything.
PYTHONPATH=src python -m gabs_scraper.pipeline --load --limit 20

# Individual stages
PYTHONPATH=src python -m gabs_scraper.pipeline --harvest    # find what's published
PYTHONPATH=src python -m gabs_scraper.pipeline --download   # fetch the PDFs
PYTHONPATH=src python -m gabs_scraper.pipeline --load       # read them into the database
```

---

## Refreshing the train timetables

PRASA does not publish a feed. What it publishes is five PDFs, and inside them are
photographs of printed sheets: about 50 characters of text layer per page against 3,249 on
a Golden Arrow one. There is nothing to parse, so the grids are read with OCR.

```bash
# Read every PDF and load what passes (~20 minutes)
PYTHONPATH=src python -m prasa_scraper.pipeline

# Put the new stations on the map
PYTHONPATH=src python -m gabs_scraper.geocode
```

The PDFs live in `data/prasa/pdfs` and are committed, the same way the Golden Arrow ones
are, so a rerun reads the same sheets rather than whatever the site serves today.

### What "held" means in the output

Reading a photograph of a table is guesswork, so every cell is checked twice: against the
shape of a time, and against the column it sits in — a train cannot reach a later station
earlier than an earlier one. A table with anything unresolved is printed as `HOLD` and
**not loaded**.

```
  load  southern-line-weekday.pdf p2.1: RETREAT - CAPE TOWN - 16 stops, 42 trips, 672 times
  part  cape-flats-line-weekday.pdf p2.1: 1 of 316 times unverified (0.32%) - loading the rest
  note  cape-flats-line-weekday.pdf p4.1: train numbers not read (1 rows)
  skip  southern-line-weekday.pdf p4.1: nothing timetable-shaped here
  HOLD  central-line-kapteinsklip-weekday.pdf p3.1: 9 unresolved of 148 times
  FAIL  central-line-kapteinsklip-weekday.pdf p2.1: grid: only 0 column rules found
```

| `load` | went into the database |
| `part` | went in, minus the cells the checks could not vouch for (see below) |
| `note` | went in, but its `TRAIN NO.` strip was split off, so the trips are unlabelled |
| `skip` | not a table — a title bar, a footer |
| `HOLD` | readable, but something in it is unproven, so none of it loaded |
| `FAIL` | no grid found at all; this is the one that means a service is missing |

**A cell the checks flagged is never written** — not by `--force`, not by anything. So a
hold is not the difference between right and wrong times in the database; it is the
difference between having a table and not having it.

That matters at the margins, because all-or-nothing gets those wrong. One unreadable cell
out of 737 was hiding 24 stations and a full day's service, to avoid one stop reading "no
published time". `--allow-unverified` names how much of that a run will accept:

```bash
# Load a table when under 3% of its cells are unverified. Those cells still do not load.
PYTHONPATH=src python -m prasa_scraper.pipeline --allow-unverified 3
```

It defaults to none, so a plain run holds anything imperfect.

**Three is measured, not chosen.** Across the five PDFs the held tables fall into two
groups with nothing between them — three at 1.2%, 1.9% and 2.8%, then the next at 5.9%
and up through 86%. The first group is a table that read cleanly with a few cells of noise
in it; the second is a table that did not read. Picking 1% instead cut through the middle
of the good group and held back the Northern Line page — the one with Kraaifontein on it —
over 7 bad cells out of 601.

Roughly 97% of cells read cleanly, and a common failure repairs itself. PRASA pads its
hours — the sheets print `05:25`, never `5:25` — so a cell read as `7:11` has lost its
first digit and has exactly two possible readings, `07:11` and `17:11`. The column decides
which: the value has to sit between the published time above it and the one below. If both
fit or neither does, nothing is written and the cell stays flagged.

The Central Line's weekend sheets are printed on a blue ground that defeats grid detection
entirely, and those tables are still held — the app shows no Central Line weekend trains
rather than wrong ones.

Searches flow the other way too: each one writes a row into the analytics tables, in the
background, without delaying the answer.

### About the Python API in `src/gabs_scraper/api.py`

That file is the original FastAPI service, kept from the migration. **It is not how you
run the app.** Java serves the API; Python's job here is scraping.

It survives as a rollback while the Java service beds in, and as the comparison target
for `backend/parity_check.py`, which proves the two return byte-identical responses across
every endpoint. It is kept fully in step, connections engine included, because a rollback
missing features is not a rollback.

Technical detail on the Java service is in [backend/README.md](backend/README.md).

## Data model

| Table | What it holds |
|---|---|
| `operator` | Who runs the service: `gabs` (bus), `metrorail` (train) |
| `route` | Origin–destination pair (`AIRPORT IND-BELLVILLE`), letter group, `operator_id` |
| `timetable` | One PDF version: number, public-holiday flag, effective dates, URL, sha256, `raw_text`, `parse_status` |
| `stop` | Distinct stop / timing-point names, plus coordinates once geocoded, `operator_id` |
| `stop_interchange` | Where a bus stop and a station are the same place, for changing between them |
| `schedule` | A (direction, day-type) block: direction label, `day_type`, `day_label`, per-page number, `no_service` |
| `schedule_stop` | Ordered stops of a schedule (`stop_sequence`) |
| `trip` | One bus run (a column in the printed grid), with footnote `note_codes` |
| `stop_time` | A single cell: `cell_type` (TIME/VIA/NONE), `departure_time`, `note_code`, `raw_value` |
| `timetable_note` | Footnote codes (`a` → "Mondays, Tuesdays, …") |
| `leg_geometry` | The real road path between two consecutive stops, for map drawing and custom-stop matching |
| `search_analytics` | One row per journey search |
| `search_analytics_option` | One row per route a search returned |

Stops and routes are unique **per operator**, not globally: RETREAT is both a Golden
Arrow stop and a Metrorail station, and they are different places a rider stands. That is
why the search results label each one, and why `stop_interchange` exists to say where two
such rows are in fact walking distance apart.

`day_type` is a coarse bucket (`WEEKDAY`/`SATURDAY`/`SUNDAY`/`PUBLIC_HOLIDAY`/`OTHER`);
`day_label` preserves the exact PDF header, e.g. `MONDAYS TO FRIDAYS`. Public-holiday PDFs
occasionally bundle several routes across pages, so each `schedule` keeps its own
`direction_label` and `section_timetable_number`.

## Example queries

```sql
-- All routes, alphabetically
SELECT name, letter_group FROM route ORDER BY name;

-- Every weekday departure from NYANGA TERM, earliest first
SELECT r.name, sc.direction_label, st.departure_time
FROM stop_time st
JOIN schedule_stop ss ON ss.id = st.schedule_stop_id
JOIN stop s           ON s.id  = ss.stop_id
JOIN schedule sc      ON sc.id = ss.schedule_id
JOIN timetable t      ON t.id  = sc.timetable_id
JOIN route r          ON r.id  = t.route_id
WHERE s.name = 'NYANGA TERM'
  AND sc.day_type = 'WEEKDAY'
  AND st.cell_type = 'TIME'
ORDER BY st.departure_time;

-- One timetable, one direction, as the printed stop × trip grid
SELECT ss.stop_sequence, s.name AS stop, tr.trip_index, st.raw_value
FROM stop_time st
JOIN trip tr          ON tr.id = st.trip_id
JOIN schedule sc      ON sc.id = tr.schedule_id
JOIN schedule_stop ss ON ss.id = st.schedule_stop_id
JOIN stop s           ON s.id  = ss.stop_id
WHERE sc.timetable_id = (SELECT id FROM timetable
                         WHERE pdf_filename LIKE 'NYANGA%' LIMIT 1)
  AND sc.day_type = 'WEEKDAY'
ORDER BY tr.trip_index, ss.stop_sequence;

-- Did anything fail to parse? (raw text is kept so it can be re-parsed)
SELECT pdf_filename, parse_error FROM timetable WHERE parse_status = 'failed';
```

## Troubleshooting

### "Connection refused" on port 5433

The database isn't running.

```bash
docker compose up -d && docker compose ps
```

### "docker: command not found" while Docker Desktop is clearly open

Docker's command-line tool isn't on your PATH. It's usually at
`C:\Program Files\Docker\Docker\resources\bin` — or, if Docker Desktop was installed
without administrator rights, at
`%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\DockerDesktop\resources\bin`.

### "Docker Desktop is unable to start" on Windows

Docker needs WSL 2. Install it from an **administrator** PowerShell, then reboot:

```bash
wsl --install
```

### Port 8000 is already in use

Another API is already running. Stop it, or start yours elsewhere with `--port 8001`
(Python) or `PORT=8001` (Java).

### Opening localhost:8000 shows `{"detail":"Not Found"}`

Either the web app has not been built, or the API started before it was.

```bash
cd web && npm install && npm run build
```

Then restart the API. It checks for `web/dist` only at startup.

### The web app loads but shows no data

The API can't reach the database, or the database is empty. Check in order:

```bash
docker compose ps
curl http://localhost:8000/api/health
```

`/api/health` reports the timetable count — if it's `0`, redo
[Step 2](#step-2--put-the-timetable-data-in).

### Stops are missing from the map

They haven't been geocoded. Run `python -m gabs_scraper.geocode`.

### Custom-stop ("drop a pin") planning finds nothing on some routes

Those routes have no road geometry yet. Run `python -m gabs_scraper.geometry` — it needs
`GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY`.

### `GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY is not set`

Put it in a `.env` file at the project root:

```
GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your-key-here
```

Only `geometry` truly requires it. `geocode` falls back to OpenStreetMap for free.
