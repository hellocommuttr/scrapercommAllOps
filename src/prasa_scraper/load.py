"""Put a read timetable into the same tables Golden Arrow uses.

The schema was built for buses but describes nothing bus-shaped: a route is a named path,
a schedule is a direction and a day type, a trip is one run along it, a stop_time is when
that run reaches a place. Trains fit without bending anything, which is why the planner
needs no new query to answer for them.

Two things differ and are handled here rather than in the schema:

  operator   stops are unique per operator now, so CAPE TOWN the station is a different
             row from CAPE TOWN the bus terminus, and neither can silently claim the
             other's departures

  arrival    PRASA marks a row A or D where a train terminates and starts again. Golden
             Arrow has no equivalent, so the marker column is read and dropped, and the
             row it belongs to is loaded as an ordinary calling point
