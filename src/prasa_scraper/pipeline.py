"""Read PRASA PDFs and load what checks out.

    PYTHONPATH=src python -m prasa_scraper.pipeline                 # everything
    PYTHONPATH=src python -m prasa_scraper.pipeline --pdf southern-line-weekday.pdf
    PYTHONPATH=src python -m prasa_scraper.pipeline --page 2 --dry-run

A page carries several tables, each read and checked on its own. One that fails its checks
is reported and held back, because the entire point of the checks is that times nobody has
looked at do not silently become departure times a rider trusts. --force loads anyway, for
when the problems have been reviewed and are understood.

A cell the checks flagged is never written, under --force or otherwise, so the question a
hold actually decides is whether an imperfect table is worth having at all. All-or-nothing
answered that badly at the margins: one unreadable cell out of 737 was hiding 24 stations
and a full day of service. --allow-unverified loads a table whose flagged cells are under
some share of it - those cells still do not load, so the affected stop reads as having no
published time rather than a wrong one.

Three per cent, measured rather than picked. Across the five PDFs the held tables fall in
two groups with nothing between them: three at 1.2, 1.9 and 2.8 per cent, then the next at
5.9 and up through 86. The first group is a table that read cleanly with a few cells of
noise in it; the second is a table that did not read. One per cent, which is what I chose
first, cut through the middle of the good group and held the Northern Line page - the one
with KRAAIFONTEIN on it - over 7 bad cells out of 601.
