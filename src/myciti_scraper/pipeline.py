"""Fetch, read and load every MyCiTi timetable.

    PYTHONPATH=src python -m myciti_scraper.pipeline --dry-run
    PYTHONPATH=src python -m myciti_scraper.pipeline

Reads what is already in data/myciti and fetches only what is missing, so a re-run after a
parser change costs nothing at the far end.

--dry-run reads every PDF and reports what it WOULD write, which is the step worth running
first: the reading is where this can go wrong, and forty-seven files is enough that a
mistake would otherwise be found one route at a time.
