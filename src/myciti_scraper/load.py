"""Put a read MyCiTi timetable into the tables the other two operators already use.

Nothing here is new shape. A route is a named path, a schedule is a direction on a kind of
day, a trip is one run along it, a stop_time is when that run reaches a place - which is
what the planner reads, so MyCiTi needs no new query to be plannable.

Three things are MyCiTi's own and are handled here rather than in the schema:

  operator    stops are unique per operator, so Civic Centre the MyCiTi station is its own
              row. It is not Golden Arrow's CAPE TOWN and must not inherit its departures

  the number  a rider looks for "D01" on the front of the bus, the way a Metrorail rider
              looks for the line. It is the timetable number, which the app already shows

  a service   spans pages rather than sitting on one, so the unit loaded is a joined run
              and the key has to name the run rather than the page
