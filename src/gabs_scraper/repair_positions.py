"""Put misplaced bus stops back on the road their route drives.

    PYTHONPATH=src python -m gabs_scraper.repair_positions --dry-run
    PYTHONPATH=src python -m gabs_scraper.repair_positions

gabs_scraper.stop_positions finds them and deliberately stops there, because a stop judged
by its neighbours is judged by evidence that could itself be wrong. This module is the
repair, and it only acts where a better coordinate can be *demonstrated* - not where one
merely looks plausible.

The fault is always the same. Golden Arrow prints a street name and the geocoder was asked
for it against the whole of Cape Town, so "CLUVER STR" - a street in Stellenbosch, on no
route but CAPE TOWN - STELLENBOSCH - came back as a Cluver in the CBD. The name was never
ambiguous to a person reading the timetable; it was ambiguous to a geocoder that was not
told which town.

So the stop's own route is the context, in two forms, strongest first:

    where its neighbours are   The stops either side of it are somewhere. Search the name
                               bounded to a box around them and a street of that name
                               inside that box is almost certainly the one meant. This
                               uses the route's own geometry rather than any guess.

    which towns it runs to     Route names are endpoints - "CAPE TOWN-STELLENBOSCH" - so
                               the name plus each of those towns is worth asking.

A candidate that lands on top of an existing stop is thrown away first, however well it
measures. That is a geocoder giving up quietly: asked for "Spekenam, Bellville" and finding
no Spekenam, it answers with Bellville. The town centre sits on the route by definition, so
it scores a perfect 0.0 km - and nineteen stops were accepted that way before the guard
existed, ROUTE 1 and ROUTE 2 both landing on BELLVILLE. A 0.0 is a warning, not a triumph.

Every surviving candidate is then MEASURED, by the same detour the finder uses: how much doubling
back does this position force on the routes this stop serves? One is accepted if it gets
under the threshold, or if it removes most of the error - KAPTEINSKLIP STN sits 48.5 km off
its route and Google places it 11.5 km off, and three quarters of the disagreement gone is
evidence in a way that a few percent is not. What remains there is its neighbours, not it.
That second door is deliberately narrow: ESCOM VILLAGE improves 44.0 to 42.1 and stays
refused, which is right.

Where nothing qualifies, the stop is left exactly as it was and reported - a wrong
coordinate is bad, and replacing it with a differently wrong one that happens to score
better is worse, because it looks fixed.

It runs in passes, because the evidence improves as it works. CLUVER STR cannot be judged
on the first pass: its neighbours on CAPE TOWN - STELLENBOSCH are MERRIMAN RD and BIRD STR,
which are themselves in the wrong place, so the correct Stellenbosch position scores worse
than the wrong CBD one and is rightly refused. Repair BIRD STR and the ground under CLUVER
STR firms up. Each pass therefore re-measures from scratch, and it stops when a pass
changes nothing.

Two sources, because they fail differently. Nominatim is free and is asked at the one
request a second its usage policy sets; it matches names literally, so it cannot find
BLUE ROUTE CENTRE (the mall is mapped as Blue Route Mall) or DALJOSAFAT STN (it is Dal
Josafat). Google reads a name the way a person would and finds both, at a cost per
request. Neither is trusted on the strength of having answered: every candidate from
either is measured against the route before it is allowed to replace anything.
