/**
 * Journeys that need a change of bus.
 *
 * <p>The direct planner answers "which single bus goes from A to B". These answer "and if
 * none does, what do I catch instead". Both queries follow the same shape:
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li>narrow to interchange candidates first — stops reachable from the origin that
 *       also reach the destination. That set is tiny (single figures to low hundreds) and
 *       costs milliseconds, and bounding the leg searches by it is the difference between
 *       a 10-second query and an 80-millisecond one;</li>
 *   <li>build each leg from real trips, keeping one representative row per physical
 *       service and time via {@code DISTINCT ON}. Without it the same connection repeats
 *       once per timetable version, exactly as the direct planner would without its
 *       grouping;</li>
 *   <li>join the legs on a shared interchange, matching day type, allowing a minimum
 *       time to change buses.</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p><b>Every leg moves forward in time.</b> A leg's arrival must be later than its
 * departure. Without that condition the between-leg checks alone were satisfied by a
 * bus that "arrived" hours before it left, and because results are ordered by total
 * journey time those impossible connections sorted straight to the top. The cost is
 * that a leg genuinely crossing midnight is excluded, which is the safer trade.
 *
 * <p><b>Which times must exist.</b> Only 28% of timetable cells carry a published time;
 * 19% are "via", meaning the bus passes but the timetable gives no time. So a leg's
 * departure and its arrival <em>at an interchange</em> must be real times — you cannot
 * plan a change you cannot time — but arrival at the final destination may be "via",
 * because for many stops that is all Golden Arrow publishes. Requiring a time there
 * finds nothing for a large part of the network.
