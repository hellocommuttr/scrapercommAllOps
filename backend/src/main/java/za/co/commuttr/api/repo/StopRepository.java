     * Stops of one kind within a straight-line distance of a point, nearest first.
     *
     * For planning from a place rather than a stop. A bus is found by the road it drives
     * down, which is what leg_geometry is for; a train is not, and a rider does not board
     * one between stations. They walk to the station - so a place near a station reaches
     * the trains that call there, and how far they walk is the whole of the story.
     *
     * <p>Nearest is not the same as useful, and taking only the four nearest threw away
     * the answer. Twenty-seven bus stops stand within walking distance of a pin dropped in
     * the Cape Town CBD, and CAPE TOWN - the terminus 219 routes run to - is the tenth of
     * them. The four that beat it are KEEROM STR, BUITENSINGEL STR, SWINDEN - LOOP STR and
     * LOOP STR. So a rider asking for Kraaifontein to Cape Town was told the train was the
     * only way, not because no bus runs it, but because the stop every bus runs to was
     * five hundred metres too far down a list that stopped at four.
     *
     * <p>So the walking radius decides who is eligible, and then two questions decide who
     * is asked: which stops are closest, and which are served most. A rider will walk past
     * a kerb with one route on it to reach the terminus nine hundred metres away, and both
     * kinds of answer belong in the list.
     *
     * <p>It stays a bounded number rather than everything inside the radius, because the
     * anchors of a busy stop are tens of thousands of rows - CAPE TOWN alone is about
     * 38,000 - and taking all twenty-seven took a CBD search from two seconds to eleven.
