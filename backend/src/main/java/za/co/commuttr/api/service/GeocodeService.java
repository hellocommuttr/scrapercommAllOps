/**
 * GET /api/geocode - the areas a rider can name.
 *
 * <p><b>Answered locally.</b> The 728 named places of the metro were fetched once from
 * OpenStreetMap and live in the {@code area} table; see {@code gabs_scraper.areas}. This
 * asked Nominatim on every pause in typing, which is a request per keystroke per user
 * against a service whose usage policy is one request a second for the whole application.
 * That is fine for one developer and impossible in public - and a rate-limited Nominatim
 * does not announce itself, it simply returns nothing, which the app can only report as
 * "no such place". WOODSTOCK and SALT RIVER disappeared from Commuttr exactly that way.
 *
 * <p>It also could not do what a search box most needs. Nominatim matches whole words, so
 * "woodst" found nothing while the stop list beside it in the same menu completed the name
 * happily. Locally it is a prefix match, so the two halves of the menu behave alike.
 *
 * <p>Nominatim is still the fallback for a query the table cannot answer, which is rare
 * and no longer on the critical path.
 *
 * <p><b>Areas only.</b> Nominatim will happily return a school, a night shelter, a scout
 * hall and a supermarket for "kraaifontein", and offering those as places to travel from
 * is a promise the timetables cannot keep. A pin gets turned into a journey by matching it
 * against the road a bus drives and the stops within walking distance, so naming a
 * building produces "a bus passes here" for a point where, as far as anything published
 * says, no bus stops at all. Golden Arrow's timetables list timing points rather than
 * every kerb, so the app cannot tell the difference between a stop it does not know about
 * and no stop.
 *
 * <p>An area is a claim the data can stand behind: name Kraaifontein and the answer is
 * about Kraaifontein, with the boarding stop named in the result so a rider knows where to
 * walk. That is one entry per area - not the eight things standing inside it.
 *
 * <p><b>And only areas the network reaches.</b> An area is worth offering when a service
 * runs through it, whether or not it is anywhere near the end of a route: Woodstock is
 * somewhere buses drive on the way into town, so a rider coming from Makhaza can get off
 * there, and it belongs in the list even though no route is named after it. Somewhere the
 * network never goes does not, and the only way to find that out used to be to choose it
 * and get an empty screen. {@link PlannerService#isServed} answers it with the same two
 * tests the planner itself would use, so an offered area is one the planner can plan from
 * by construction.
 *
 * <p>The named stops and stations in the same menu come from /api/stops, which is the
 * app's own data, so filtering here removes nothing a rider can actually board at.
 * EERSTE RIVER is not tagged as a place in OSM at all - it comes back as the river - and
 * is still searchable, because it is a station and a bus stop in the database.
